# Quinidine-DDGI-Model

Model of published clinical quinidine drug-drug-(gene) interactions, where quinidine either acts as perpetrator or as victim

## Repository files
A whole-body PBPK model of quinidine, evaluated within a comprehensive CYP2D6-CYP3A4-P-gp DD(G)I modeling network is provided, including in total 13 compounds.
The model snapshot contains simulations of the clinical interaction studies used during model development, including the respective observed data digitized from literature reports. For further details, please refer to [[1](#reference)].
